# chat-app
A local chat app made with React, flux, Express and socket.io


To run, direct to the folder and run `node server`.


Before starting the server run `npm run build` if you made any changes.


To start the dev-server run `npm start` instead.


The devserver will only work for one user while the build server will use socket.io to send and retrieve messages.
